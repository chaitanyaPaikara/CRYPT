    Number used as logic:                      294 out of   5,720    5%
      Number using O6 output only:             264
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   30
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    89 out of   1,430    6%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                        0 out of   2,860    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          296
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           210 out of     296   70%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   2 out of     296    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          84 out of     296   28%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              23 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
